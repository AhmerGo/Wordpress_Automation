WordPress Site Automation Script
This script automates the process of setting up a WordPress site on an AWS EC2 instance. It configures Apache, MySQL, PHP, installs WordPress, and sets up a domain with SSL using Certbot. It also automates the DNS record creation on AWS Route 53.

Requirements
The script must be run as root or with sudo privileges.
AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions for Route 53.
MySQL server installed and the root password must be known.
Apache server with PHP support.
Certbot with Apache plugin.
WP-CLI (WordPress Command Line Interface).
jq for parsing JSON in shell scripts.
Usage
sh
Copy code
sudo bash script_name.sh subdomain.domain [--type=all]
Replace script_name.sh with the actual name of the script file. subdomain.domain should be replaced with the actual subdomain and domain name where you want to install WordPress. The --type argument is optional.

Steps Performed by the Script
Validation and Argument Parsing: The script checks if it's run as root and if the correct number of arguments is supplied. It parses the domain name and optional type from the arguments.

User Interaction for Database Password: The script prompts the user to enter and confirm the database password.

System Update and Package Installation: The script updates the system's package index. (Note: The script includes a section for checking and installing necessary packages if they're not installed, but this part is currently commented out.)

MySQL Database and User Creation: The script creates a new MySQL database and user and grants the user full privileges on the new database.

WordPress Download and Configuration: The script sets up the directory structure for the new site, downloads the latest WordPress, adjusts file permissions, and configures the wp-config.php file with the new database details.

Apache Virtual Host Configuration: The script creates a new virtual host configuration file for Apache to serve the new WordPress site.

SSL Certificate Setup with Certbot: The script uses Certbot to obtain an SSL certificate for the domain.

WordPress Installation: The script installs WordPress and creates an admin user with the details specified in the script variables.

AWS Route 53 DNS Record Creation: The script creates a new A record in AWS Route 53, pointing to the EC2 instance's public IP.

Please review the script before running it on a live system, especially if you have existing configurations that might conflict with the settings in this script.

Ensure that users understand they need to have the necessary tools installed and configured (like the AWS CLI, MySQL server, etc.) and that running scripts as root or with sudo can make significant changes to their system, so they should review the script thoroughly before execution.
